# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow, as well as introduce myself.
My name is Azarya, I'm in my first year as a Computer Science major.
I'm hoping to get into cybersecurity and am actively working on my communication skills.
On the lookout for any experience I can gain, whether it be through small projects or internships.
